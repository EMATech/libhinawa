## Instruction

I design this library to send asynchronous transaction from Linux userspace
applications to units on IEEE 1394 bus by any language binding for GObject
Introspection. According to this design, this library is an application of Linux
FireWire subsystem and GLib/GObject.

Furthermore, my recent work since 2013 for Linux sound subsystem, a.k.a
ALSA, adds any loadable wodules for Linux kernel to handle some Audio and
Music units on IEEE 1394 bus by ALSA PCM/RawMidi/HwDep/Sequencer interfaces.
This library includes some helper objects to handle model-specific asynchronous
transactions with helps of the drivers. According to this design, a part of
this library is an application of Linux sound subsystem.

## Example of Python3 with PyGobject

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import gi
gi.require_version('Hinawa', '2.0')
from gi.repository import Hinawa

unit = Hinawa.SndUnit()
unit.open('/dev/snd/hwC0D0')
unit.listen()

addr = 0xfffff0000904
req = Hinawa.FwReq()
frames = req.read(unit, addr, 4)
for i, frame in enumerate(frames):
    print('{0:016x}: {0:02x}'.format(addr + i, frame))
```

## License

- GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later
- A UAPI header of Linux kernel (include/uapi/sound/firewire.h) is included
  for backport (src/backport.h). This is licensed under GNU General Public
  License version 2. You can build libhinawa without the backport header. In
  this case libhinawa is built with the UAPI header installed in your system.

## Dependencies
- Glib 2.34.0 or later
- GObject Introspection 1.32.1 or later
- Linux kernel 3.12 or later

## Requirements to build
- Meson 0.32.0 or later
- Ninja
- PyGObject (optional to run unit tests)
- GTK-Doc 1.18-2 (optional to generate API documentation)

## How to build

```
$ meson . build
$ cd build
$ ninja
$ ninja install
($ ninja test)
```

## How to refer document

```
$ meson -Dgtk_doc=true . build
$ cd build
$ ninja
$ ninja install
```

## Sample scripts

```
$ ./samples/run.sh [gtk|qt4|qt5]
```
gtk - PyGObject is required.
qt4 - PyQt4 is required (also test python2).
qt5 - PyQt5 is required.
